# Contributing to My GoGin Server Project

First, thank you for considering contributing to this project! Your help is essential to improving it. The following guidelines are intended to make the process straightforward and to ensure high code quality and maintainability.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Prerequisites
- Ensure that **Golang** is installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- This project uses the **Gin framework** for handling HTTP requests. You can install it using:
    ```bash
    go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
    ```
    
### 2. Fork and Clone the Repository
1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the project page.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rohankarn69/AUTOMATIC-NEWS-SERVER
     ```

### 3. Create a New Branch
Always create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
```

### 4. Code Guidelines
To maintain the quality and readability of the project, follow these coding conventions:

#### a. Use the Gin Framework
- This project **must** use the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) framework. Avoid using any other HTTP server libraries.
    
#### b. Clean Code Principles
- Follow [Go's best practices](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and aim for clean, readable code.
- **Naming conventions** are important:
    - Use descriptive names for functions, methods, variables, and packages.
    - Function names should indicate what they do, e.g., `HandleLogin`, `FetchUsers`.
    - Avoid short or ambiguous names like `x`, `y`, `tmp`.

#### c. Package Structure
- Organize your code into clearly named packages, following the **Go package conventions**.
    - For example, use `routes/` for your route handlers, `services/` for business logic, and `models/` for database schemas.
    
#### d. Error Handling
- Handle errors properly using Go idioms, e.g.:
    ```go
    if err != nil {
            return err
    }
    ```
- Return descriptive error messages to make debugging easier.

#### e. Commenting and Documentation
- Use Go’s commenting style for exported functions, types, and methods. Example:
    ```go
    // HandleLogin processes login requests and returns a token.
    func HandleLogin(c *gin.Context) {...}
    ```
- Document your code to make it easy for others (and yourself) to understand.

### 5. Testing
- Ensure that all new code has accompanying **unit tests**.
- Use Go’s built-in testing framework:
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```
- Test cases should cover various scenarios, including edge cases.

### 6. Commit Message Format
Please write clear and descriptive commit messages. A typical format would be:
```plaintext
[Feature] Add user authentication

- Implement login and logout functionality
- Add JWT token handling
```

### 7. Pull Request Process
1. After making your changes, push your branch to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-branch
     ```
2. Go to the original repository and submit a pull request.
3. Ensure that the PR clearly describes:
     - The feature or bug fix introduced.
     - The problem solved or the new functionality added.
4. Your pull request will be reviewed. Please be open to feedback and responsive to any requested changes.

### 8. Code of Conduct
Be respectful in your contributions and interactions with the community. We follow the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
